# Simple Calculator

To use this command-line calculator, start the application. It will prompt you to select an arithmetic operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. 
After choosing, you'll be asked to input two numbers. The result of the calculation will be displayed, and you can then choose to perform another calculation or exit the application.

## Languages and Frameworks Used
This project uses JavaScript as the programming language and leverages the Node.js runtime environment to execute the application. The readline-sync library is used to handle user input and output in the command line.
